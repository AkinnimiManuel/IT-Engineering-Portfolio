# ü™ü Windows Server Setup Guide

This guide documents the steps I followed to install and configure **Windows Server** in my home lab. I used this environment to practice system administration tasks such as Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, file sharing, and more.


## ‚úÖ Requirements

- **Windows Server ISO** (Windows Server 2022)
- Virtualization platform (VMware)
- Laptop configuration **2 GB RAM**, **2 CPUs**, and **20 GB** disk space
- Internet connection for activation and updates

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

### 1. Create a Virtual Machine

- I Opened my VMware workstation pro and created a new VM with the following specs:
  - **Name**: Windows Server
  - **Type**: Microsoft Windows
  - **Version**: Windows 2022 (64-bit)
  - **RAM**: 2096 MB (minimum)
  - **CPU**: 2 cores

### 5. Install Guest Additions VMware Tools

- This helps with better resolution, clipboard sharing, etc.

### 6. Set Static IP Address

- I went to the `Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings`
- Right-click on Ethernet > Properties > IPv4
- Then I Set an IP and use google DNS:
  - IP Address: `192.168.x.x`
  - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
  - Gateway: `192.168.x.1`
  - DNS: `8.8.8.8`



## ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Configuration

### 7. Rename the Server

- I Opened PowerShell as Admin and use the following command to rename my serverto STEF001 and restarted immediately so the changed can take effect:
  ```powershell
  Rename-Computer -NewName "STEFF-001" -Restart


üß† Lessons Learned
   - Always install Guest Additions early for better usability

   - Static IPs make domain services much easier to configure

   - PowerShell is your best friend for automation
