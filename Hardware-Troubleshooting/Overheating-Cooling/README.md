# **Overheating & Cooling Troubleshooting**  

This folder covers troubleshooting steps for preventing system overheating and optimizing cooling solutions.  

## **🛠 Common Issues & Fixes**  

### 🔥 **Laptop or Desktop Overheating**  
- Check CPU and GPU temperatures using **HWMonitor** or **Core Temp**.  
- Clean dust from fans, heatsinks, and vents.  
- Improve airflow by using a laptop cooling pad or repositioning desktop fans.  

### ❄ **Cooling Fan Not Working**  
- Check BIOS settings to ensure fan control is enabled.  
- Use SpeedFan to monitor fan speeds.  
- Replace defective fans or thermal paste if necessary.  

### 🏎 **PC Throttling Due to Heat**  
- Lower CPU clock speed in BIOS to reduce heat output.  
- Ensure proper ventilation by keeping the PC in a cool environment.  
- Upgrade to a better cooling system (e.g., liquid cooling or high-performance air coolers).  

✅ **Key Takeaways:**  
✔ Identify and fix overheating problems in PCs and laptops.  
✔ Optimize airflow and cooling solutions.  
✔ Prevent system damage due to excessive heat.
