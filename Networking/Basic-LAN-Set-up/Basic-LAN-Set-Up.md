# üñ•Ô∏èüîß Basic LAN & WLAN Setup (Cisco Packet Tracer)

Welcome to my **Basic LAN & Wireless LAN Setup** project!  
This lab is one of my early hands-on exercises with networking fundamentals using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It combines **wired and wireless networking**, **DHCP**, **static IPs**, **default gateway configuration**, and some basic **inter-device communication**. üöÄ

## üóÇÔ∏è Topology Overview

Here's what I built:

### üåê LAN Segment
- üñ•Ô∏è **5 PCs**
- üñ®Ô∏è **2 Printers** (with static IPs)
- üîå **2 Switches**
- üåê **1 Router** (with DHCP enabled)

### üì° Wireless Segment
- üíª **3 Laptops**
- üì∂ **1 Wireless Router** (separate network)

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Connecting Devices
- PCs and printers were connected to the two switches using **copper straight-through cables**.

- Switches were connected to each other and to the **router**.
- Wireless router connected via **Ethernet to the router** (for internet simulation).
- Laptops connected wirelessly using the **SSID and WPA2 security**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ IP Addressing

#### Assign each segment thier own IP address
![Seperate networks](images/03-seperate-networks.png)
- Clicked on router -> CLI -> typed in the following commands to enable port
```
int gi0/0
no shut
exit
int gi0/1
no shut
exit 
do wr
``` 
![Enable port](images/04-enable-port.png)

#### üì¶ LAN Devices (PCs & Printers)
- **DHCP** enabled on the router interface for PCs:
  - **Network:** `192.168.1.0/24`
  - **Default Gateway:** `192.168.1.1`
![Set default gateway](images/06-set-default-gateway.png)


- üñ®Ô∏è **Printers** were manually assigned:
  - HALLWAY printer: `192.168.1.105`
  ![Hallway printer IP](images/15-hallway-printer.png)
  - MANAGER printer: `192.168.1.107`
  ![Manager printer](images/16-manager-printer.png)

#### üåê Router Configuration (LAN Side)

```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
exit

ip dhcp pool WiredLAN
 network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
 default-router 192.168.1.1
 
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Wireless Router & WLAN

* Wireless Router configured with a different **subnet**:

  * Network: `192.168.2.0/24`
  ![IP address](images/10-ip-address-of-wireless-router.png)
  * SSID: `MANUEL-TECH3`
  ![change SSID](images/08-change-the-SSID.png)
  * Security: WPA2-PSK, Password: `emmylashtins22`
  ![Set password](images/09-set-password.png)

* Laptops successfully connected to `MANUEL-TECH3` and acquired IPs automatically.

### PCs DHCP successful
- IT-PC DHCP successful

## üß™ Testing & Verification

‚úÖ **PCs pinged each other successfully** across both switches.
‚úÖ **All PCs printed to both printers** using static IPs.
![IT pc ping printer](images/17-IT-pc-ping-hallway-printer.png)
![HR pc ping printer](images/18-HR-PC-ping-manager-printer.png)
‚úÖ **Laptops browsed the internet (simulated)** through the wireless router.
‚úÖ **Ping tests confirmed separation of LAN and WLAN** unless routing is manually added.

## üß† What I Learned

* Setting up **interconnected switches** for scalable LANs
* Configuring **DHCP** on routers and understanding address pools
* Assigning **static IPs** for key network devices like printers
* Creating a **segmented wireless network** using a wireless router
* Using **basic commands** like `ping`, `ipconfig`, `show ip dhcp binding`, etc., to troubleshoot

## üìå Future Improvements

* Introduce **VLANs** for better segmentation
* Enable **Inter-VLAN routing** for communication between wireless and wired networks
* Add **firewall ACLs** for basic security
* Simulate **internet access** through NAT configuration
