## 🧠 What I'm Learning

Here’s a breakdown of what I’ve been diving into:

- 🧩 **OSI & TCP/IP Models** – Breaking down how data flows step-by-step across networks.
- 🌍 **IP Addressing & Subnetting** – Binary ninja mode: ON 🧠💡
- 🔧 **Router & Switch Configuration** – Basic setup using CLI commands.
- 🛜 **DHCP, DNS, NAT, and PAT** – Essential network services explained and configured.
- 🔐 **Firewall Rules & Port Forwarding** – Getting serious with security.
- 📡 **Wireshark Packet Analysis** – Peeking under the hood of network traffic 🚗💨
- 🧪 **Ping, Tracert, Netstat, Nslookup, Telnet** – My daily diagnostic toolkit.
