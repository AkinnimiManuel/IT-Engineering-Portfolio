![Active directory image](images/activeDirectory2.png)

## Overview  
This project highlights my ability to set up and configure a **Domain Controller (DC)** in an **Active Directory (AD) environment**. It includes key tasks such as installing **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**, configuring **DNS**, promoting the server to a domain controller, and implementing **security policies** using Group Policy Objects (GPOs).  

## What’s Included  
- **Domain Controller Installation** – Setting up AD DS on Windows Server.  
- **DNS Configuration** – Ensuring proper name resolution for domain services.  
- **Domain Promotion** – Converting the server into a domain controller.  
- **Replication & Redundancy Setup** – Ensuring high availability of directory services.  

## Skills Demonstrated  
- Windows Server Administration  
- Active Directory & DNS Configuration  
- IT Support & Network Security  

## Why This Matters  
A **Domain Controller** is the backbone of enterprise identity management, enabling **centralized authentication, user management, and security enforcement**. This project demonstrates my ability to deploy and manage a reliable domain infrastructure, ensuring efficient IT operations and security compliance.
