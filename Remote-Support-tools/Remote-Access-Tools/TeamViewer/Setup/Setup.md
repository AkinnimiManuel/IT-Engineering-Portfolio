## Real-World Use Case

When helping users remotely, I typically:
- Ask for their TeamViewer ID and temporary password
- Connect to their device securely
- Guide them through issues or take control to fix problems directly

I also use the file transfer feature to send tools or retrieve logs.

## Security Settings

Some things I make sure to configure:
- Enable **two-factor authentication** on my TeamViewer account
