# Remote Support Tools

Hi there! I'm Emmanuel Stefan, and this folder is part of my IT Support portfolio. It showcases my hands-on experience and growing expertise with **remote support tools**, including both **ticketing systems** and **remote access software**.

As someone passionate about providing efficient tech support and streamlining issue resolution, I’ve been exploring and documenting tools that are widely used in real-world IT environments.

## What's in this Repository?

This folder is divided into two main sections:

### 1. Ticketing Systems
These tools help track, manage, and resolve support requests from users. I’ve tested and documented:
- **Freshdesk**
- **Jira Service Management**
- **ServiceNow**

Each subfolder contains:
- Setup and configuration steps  
- Sample support ticket flows  
- Key features explored  
- Screenshots or screen recordings (where applicable)

### 2. Remote Access Tools
These are tools that allow technicians to connect to client machines and perform troubleshooting remotely. I’ve worked with:
- **TeamViewer**
- **AnyDesk**
- **Windows Remote Desktop (RDP)**

Each subfolder includes:
- Connection setup guides  
- Real-world use cases  
- Security features and settings  
- Tips for smooth remote sessions

## Why This Project?

I’m building this portfolio to document my journey into the world of IT support and remote troubleshooting. My goal is to:
- Strengthen my skills with tools used by IT teams globally  
- Practice resolving support issues efficiently  
- Share knowledge with others who are also getting started in this space
