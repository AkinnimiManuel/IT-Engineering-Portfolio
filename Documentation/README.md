## 🛠️ Tools I Use for Documentation

- 🧠 **Notion** – for planning, journaling, and tracking progress
- 📝 **Markdown (.md)** – for clean, readable GitHub documentation
- 📷 **Screenshots** – visual walk-throughs where needed
- 📑 **PDF Exports** – for sharing formatted versions externally
- 📊 **Tables, flowcharts, and checklists** – wherever clarity is needed

I document to:
- 💾 Keep a personal record of my learning
- 🔄 Repeat and scale successful setups/projects
- 🧭 Help others understand and replicate what I’ve built
- ✅ Stay organized when switching between tasks or systems
